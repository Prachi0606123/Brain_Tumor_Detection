Project Title: Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning


Objective:
Developed a deep learning-based application to accurately identify brain tumors from MRI scans, assisting in early diagnosis and enhancing healthcare outcomes.

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
•	Compiled a dataset of over 200+ MRI images from reliable sources, ensuring diversity in tumor types and sizes.
•	Performed data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, and scaling) to increase dataset size and improve model generalization.
•	Applied image preprocessing methods, including normalization, resizing, and noise reduction, to enhance image quality for analysis.

Model Development:
•	Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for medical image classification.
•	Experimented with multiple deep learning models (ResNet, VGG) to benchmark performance against custom CNN model.
•	Trained the model using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy in detecting tumors.

Evaluation and Optimization:
•	Utilized metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
•	Achieved a tumor detection accuracy of 95%, outperforming baseline models.
•	Reduced training time and enhanced model efficiency by optimizing hyperparameters, including learning rate and batch size.

Implementation:
•	Developed a Python-based user interface to visualize MRI scans and display detection results, making the application user-friendly for healthcare professionals.
•	Deployed the model locally for real-time predictions and ensured scalability for potential cloud deployment.

Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas

Insights:
•	Achieved a detection accuracy of 95%, demonstrating the potential for practical clinical application.
